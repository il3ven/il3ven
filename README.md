### About Me
I love 🤍 all levels of computer science. I'll clasify myself as a self taught engineer. I am also pursuing a computer science degree which is expected to be completed in 2021. Technology is my first love and science is the second.

#### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
Projects that tackle some complex problems. Or provide solution to a real life problem. It is a bonus if I am personally affected by the problem.
